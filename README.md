Compilation of CS2040 forum "Soap Operas" (read: problem sets)

1. To begin our soap opera, we are interested to find out
the number of days betwen two give dates. This could be
used by some banking applications for calculating daily
based interest, etc. The input are two dates in the format
ddmmyyyy. 
    What you need to do is to identify all the sub-problems
and then describe your solution to each sub-problem. Your
solution should not make use of any library routines in any
programming language. That is, you have to do everything
yourself.
    Please do not be satisfied with the first idea that comes
to your mind. Think carefully and you may find a better
solution. In particular, if your solution has many nested if
statemen, you should try to find a better solution.
    You do not need to implement your algorithm. Just pseudo
code will do.  
     As I said during the lecture, you must have a complete
algorithm before you start coding.
